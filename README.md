## About me
I'm a retired system architect that started as COBOL programmer p√• mainframes in 1983. I started in 1989 with what was called "image processing" (high speed processing and interpretation of scanned documents). It was then natural to use Unix and C. Later I worked as a system architect on digital archives and document management systems developed in C, C ++ and Java.

After retiring, I still have to develop just for fun. I have developed basic java applications, java applications for Android, MonkeyC applications for Garmin training watches and most recently NodeJS application for Athom Homey. In order for source not to be lost and because others may benefit from what I have developed, I will gradually post source on this platform.

## Interests
My interests revolve around digital archives based on the Web Service interface, smart homes and training apps.
