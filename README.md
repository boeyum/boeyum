## About me
I'm a retired system architect that started as COBOL programmer p√• mainframes in 1983. I started in 1989 with what was called "image processing" (high speed processing and interpretation of scanned documents). It was then natural to use Unix and C. Later I worked as a system architect on digital archives and document management systems developed in C, C ++ and Java.

Since I retired, I have developed my own apps for Android, for Garmin training watches and most recently for the Homey smart home controller.

## Interests
My interests revolve around digital archives based on the Web Service interface, smart homes and training apps.
